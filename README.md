# mayor2
need to add description and web page to site through gh-pages in the description/edit section. example: 
Description: Kayla for mayor website
Website: http://kayla-mitchell.github.io/mayor2/mayor1.html
Secondly you have double Images folders, you also capitalized the folder named images and on your site. This will work but this is not the standard. I am investagating if your images are NOT on the first level of yours dual "Images folder".
